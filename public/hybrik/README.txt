System Requirements:
- node.js v4+
- npm

If you already have a node.js environment setup, skip to step 2.
1. Install node.js -> Can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en/ (pick the latest LTS version) . This install will include npm (node.js package manger)
2. From a terminal or command prompt, go to the directory where the samples were extracted to. There should be several JS files there.
3. Run "npm install" from this directory. This will install other package dependencies into a node_modules subdirectory.
4. Edit the settings in api_config.js to use your api credentials.
5. Run the desired example script from terminal or command prompt:
Submit Job -> "node submit_job.js sample_job.json"
Display All Jobs -> "node display_all_jobs.js"
Delete All Jobs -> "node delete_all_jobs.js"
